    "content": "I started in Capgemini as an intern, researching about Three.js and 3D development using Angular Three and NgRx. I have been working on a 3D project with animations, physics, collisions and state management. As the application was scaling, I decided to migrated the project from Angular to React to improve the performance with React Three Fiber library, using TypeScript, Redux, Node.js with Express and Mongo DB Atlas. During this time I tried to document all my code as well as I could. Because of that I created an onboarding Wiki for new employees to make it easy for them to start using the application. I have also worked with Tailwind CSS to style the entire application."
