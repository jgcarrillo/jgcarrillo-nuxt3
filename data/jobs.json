    "content": "I started in Capgemini as an intern, researching about Three.js and 3D development using Angular Three and NgRx. I have been working on a 3D project with animations, physics, collisions and state management. Later on, the project was migrated from Angular to React to improve the performance with React Three Fiber library, using TypeScript, Redux, Node.js with Express and Mongo DB Atlas. At the same time I have created an onboarding Wiki for new employees and I have also worked with Tailwind CSS."
