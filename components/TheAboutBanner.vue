      Ciao! My name is Jorge G√≥mez, I am 32 years old and I'm currently living
      in Murcia, Spain. I studied building engineer at the UCAM university and
      later on I decided to move on Web Development studying a Higher Technical
      Qualification.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3 tracking-wide">
      Thanks to these studies I have been able to learn the basics of
      programming and I have also learned on my own design patterns or software
      architectures.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3 tracking-wide">
      Since then, I have decided to specialize, above all, in JavaScript
      technologies. Since I started the practices until today, I have worked
      mostly using Vue and React, creating user interfaces with Tailwind CSS. In
      addition to JavaScript, I also really like PHP, Laravel and Symfony. Also
      this year I hope to get some time to learn GO, because I have in mind some
      CLI applications that could be interesting. I am also an enthusiast of Vim
      and Neovim and, although I am not using these editors in my day to day
      life, I am in love with Vim shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3 tracking-wide">
      In my spare time I take the time to learn new technologies through books,
      articles or videos. What I love most is software architecture,
      craftsmanship and design patterns. Thanks to books such as Uncle Bob's
      Clean Architecture or Pragmatic Programmer I have learned beyond just
      programming: code quality, testing, etc. Everything I am learning I always
      try to put it into practice in my side projects, there is always something
      to improve!
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3 tracking-wide">
      As you can see, software and my side projects occupies a large part of my
      life, although I also like to travel, reading, and above all, mechanical
      keyboards. And of course... I also like to enjoy the weekend with my
      family and friends cooking some pizzas! üçï
